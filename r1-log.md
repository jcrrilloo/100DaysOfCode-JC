  ### Today's Progress:
  * Spent most of my time working updating my github to be professional and presentable. I did this by following the guidelines for tracking your own work, showing progress and explaining the resources one will use to successfully learn front end development. I successfully customized my 'readme.md' file to fit my journey. I also updated my 'resources.md' file to fit my personal journey and did a journey map on figma to outline path to success in HTML/CSS & Javascript
  * In addition to setting up my github repos etc. I also made some progress in the 'Javascript ALog and Data Structures' freecodeCampe cert course. Progress from step[60] - step[81] in the 'Pyramid Generator' program
  * Posted day 01 in Discord - 100DaysOfCode channel

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1.forking someone elses repo and the difference of forking vs cloning
  2. contuining to learn how to write in Markdown
  ### Thoughts:
  * Setting up an enviroment where you can hold yourself accountable is important. I have tried being a frontend developer for so long and have always fell off. I have learned that when you have no motivation you fall back on the systems you have created for yourself. This github and the 
environment that I am setting up for myself is ensuring that I consistently continue my journey and make progress no matter how little

  ### Time spent working
  * 2.5 hrs
