  ### Today's Progress:
  * Spent most of my time working updating my github to be professional and presentable. I did this by following the guidelines for tracking your own work, showing progress and explaining the resources one will use to successfully learn front end development. I successfully customized my 'readme.md' file to fit my journey. I also updated my 'resources.md' file to fit my personal journey and did a journey map on figma to outline path to success in HTML/CSS & Javascript
  * In addition to setting up my github repos etc. I also made some progress in the 'Javascript ALog and Data Structures' freecodeCampe cert course. Progress from step[60] - step[81] in the 'Pyramid Generator' program
  * Posted day 01 in Discord - 100DaysOfCode channel

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1.forking someone elses repo and the difference of forking vs cloning
  2. contuining to learn how to write in Markdown
  ### Thoughts:
  * Setting up an enviroment where you can hold yourself accountable is important. I have tried being a frontend developer for so long and have always fell off. I have learned that when you have no motivation you fall back on the systems you have created for yourself. This github and the 
environment that I am setting up for myself is ensuring that I consistently continue my journey and make progress no matter how little

  ### Today's Progress:
  * Spent all of my time making progress on freecodecamps javascript pyramid generator program. left off on step [80] - made progress all the way to step [102]. Total of [106] steps so I will be finishing that as part of my Day 03 work. 
 
  * Posted Day 02 in Discord - 100DaysOfCode channel

  ### Link to work:

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1.working with loops more. Nested loops. Unshift() function and what it does to element in an array[].How to use a while,for loop together. 
  2. .push() function : adds new elements(items) to the end of an array[]
  3. .unshift() function: allows one to add one or more elements into an array[]
  4. 
  ### Thoughts:
  * I am not a huge fan of the fcc 'ide' environment. I get you are following steps and the whole point is to accomplish the larger project but it has you do three/four different methods of the same project and it can get confusing on what should be best practice. In my opinion it would be better suited to teach the fundementals to get the problem / challenge solved. then highlight different ways to go about it.

 <summary>Day 3: May 4,2024</summary>

  ### Today's Progress:
  * finished freecodecamps javascript pyramid generator program. The basis of this project was to introduce naming variables, the difference between a 'const' && 'let' declaration. How to use strings and assign boolean factors. In addition, this topic covered how to use a function and pass parameters with a return value. In the function we created we also covered .operators such as '.repeat()' which returns a string with a number of copies of that string. It does not change the orginal awake, just makes a copy and returns it as a new string. 

 * Topics also covered were 'for loops' and 'if' 'else' conditions and how to use a function() within a for loop. The console.log() statement was covered and shown how to print to the console and lastly two other .operators / functions were introduced such as the '.unshift() && .push()' functions.
 * Some other topics included decrements and increments, and learning how to provide different outputs using for loops
 * .unshift() : can be used to ad done or more elements to the <strong>beginning</strong> of an array. The orginal array[] is modified by adding that specified element in the front and shifitng those existing elements
 * .push() : can be used to add one or more elements at the <strong>END</strong> of an array[] it still modifies the orginal array and returns the value with your added node.

  ### Today's Progress:
  * Working on free code camps ' learn basic javascript by building a role playing game'. made progress on this project which has a total of [174] steps
  * Posted in Discord - 100DaysOfCode channel

  ### Link to work:

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1. how & what the 'document.querySelector()' does in the DOM and how we can use it in JS
  2. how to target a property in HTML and change its property value using the document.querySelector()
  3. how to initialize buttons using the '.onclick() method and assigning it's value to your functions and buttons. 
  4. also learned how to style our game using simple css 
  ### Thoughts:
  * liking how we are finally working a bit more on javascript and the console. Outside of free code camps environment, MDN has been a good resource to learn and try different javascript programs. Another progression has been the free code camps javascript tutorial which is a 20hr long tutorial for full stack.
