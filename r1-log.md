  ### Today's Progress:
  * Spent most of my time working updating my github to be professional and presentable. I did this by following the guidelines for tracking your own work, showing progress and explaining the resources one will use to successfully learn front end development. I successfully customized my 'readme.md' file to fit my journey. I also updated my 'resources.md' file to fit my personal journey and did a journey map on figma to outline path to success in HTML/CSS & Javascript
  * In addition to setting up my github repos etc. I also made some progress in the 'Javascript ALog and Data Structures' freecodeCampe cert course. Progress from step[60] - step[81] in the 'Pyramid Generator' program

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1.forking someone elses repo and the difference of forking vs cloning
  2. contuining to learn how to write in Markdown
  ### Thoughts:
  * Setting up an enviroment where you can hold yourself accountable is important. I have tried being a frontend developer for so long and have always fell off. I have learned that when you have no motivation you fall back on the systems you have created for yourself. This github and the 
environment that I am setting up for myself is ensuring that I consistently continue my journey and make progress no matter how little

  ### Today's Progress:
  * Spent all of my time making progress on freecodecamps javascript pyramid generator program. left off on step [80] - made progress all the way to step [102]. Total of [106] steps so I will be finishing that as part of my Day 03 work. 
 
  * Posted Day 02 in Discord - 100DaysOfCode channel

  ### Link to work:
  * None

  ### New thing(s) learned:
  1.working with loops more. Nested loops. Unshift() function and what it does to element in an array[].How to use a while,for loop together. 
  2. .push() function : adds new elements(items) to the end of an array[]
  3. .unshift() function: allows one to add one or more elements into an array[]
  4. 
  ### Thoughts:
  * I am not a huge fan of the fcc 'ide' environment. I get you are following steps and the whole point is to accomplish the larger project but it has you do three/four different methods of the same project and it can get confusing on what should be best practice. In my opinion it would be better suited to teach the fundementals to get the problem / challenge solved. then highlight different ways to go about it.
