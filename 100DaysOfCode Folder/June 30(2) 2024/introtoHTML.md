# Intro to HTML
## Hypertext Markup Language
* used across to build web pages across the World Wide Web ( www )
* orginally invented so scientist could share their results
* the `document` was a research paper and `HTML` was the format it was the format it was written in
* the format is the format that consisted of elements, tags, attributes

### HTML Structure
* consist of four basic parts called `tags` :
1. `<html>`
2. `<head>`
3. `<title>`
4. `<body>`
* a basic structure of an HTML document will consist of the 'shell' `<!DOCTYPE HTML>` which identifies  what kind of document we are working with
* the structure will also  have your 'root' `<html>` element
* followed by the `<head>` and `<body>`
* within the `<head>` each document should have a `<title>` stating the 'name' of the document this helps tell the browser what the name of your document should be read as

### Adding content to your HTML document
* `<body>` element will 'hold' or 'hug' the rest of the contents of your document
* elements that could be nested within your body tag could consist of the following :
- `<p>`
- `<h1>` - `<h6>`
- `<img>`
etc...
# HTML Tags
* is any text that you write inside the angle brackets `<>`
* angle brackets is used to tell the browser how to display or transform the regular text located between the 'start' tage and the 'closing tag'
* ex. open/start tag `<>` ... close end tag `</>`
* ***note*** : some tags may not have 'closing' tags
* closing tags are associated with the 'slash' `/` symbol
# HTML Elements
* a component of the HTML document that tells  the browser how to interpret  the information of yoour doc
*  when a tag has an opening and a closing tag that is when we refer to it as an 'element'
* all of the content between the opening and closing tags is the 'contents' of that element
* if a tag is not suppose to have a closing tag than we can also refer to it as an `element`
* some tags that do not need a closing tag are
1. `<img>`
2. `<br>`
3. `<input>`
4. `<col>`
etc....
