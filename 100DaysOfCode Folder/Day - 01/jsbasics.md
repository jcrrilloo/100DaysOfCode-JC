**NOTE** : 
* Javascript follows the mathematical ordeer of operations(PEMDAS) and you can use the '()' braces to forcee precedence in a equation or program
### Booleans : 
* True / False type
**NOTE**  : validates  statementts bases on a true/false statement. 
* Statementt could be a string statementt or an arthimetic statement
