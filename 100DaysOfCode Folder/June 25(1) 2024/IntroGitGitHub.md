# Intro to Git and GitHub
### Git
* `Git` : is a version control system that manages and keeps track of your code
* Programmers need a way to manage program updates and any changes made. Git helps keep track of this for dev teams
* `Git` : operates on the CLI and lets you input commands into a terminal to process a set of instructions
#### Common Commands:
* `git init` : initializes Git in your folder
* `git add Readme.md` : lets you add a 'Readme' file
* `git add . ` : lets you add all files in the present folder
* `git commit -m` : creates a new branch which is a new version of the repo as it appears when added. `-M` is to move the name to the main branch
* `git branch` : creates a new branch, which is a new versiono of the repoo as it appears when added, and `-M` is to move the name to `main`
* `git remote add origin` : connects the local folder to the repo on `GitHub`
* `git push -u origin main` : `pushes` the code to `GitHub` ... The `-u` flag creates a reference that tracks the activity for the branch and `origin main` puts the code in the `main` branch

### GitHub :
* GitHub uses `Git` underneath and let's  you manage your `git` repos or folders on it's platform
* GitHub the Platform is a web based service that lets you host, share and manage your code files on the internet
* GitHub allows you to visually see changes, codee progress and collaborations across different developers remotely over the cloud.
* You can take a project and clone it locally to your machine and push it to the cloud with or without actively altereing your main project.. this allows for multiple developers to work on the same project but see it's constant updates using `Git` + `GitHub`
