## The DOM

What is the DOM? : Document Object Model, DOM is the document that consists of objects that reperesent the structure and contents for the web. DOM works with HTML, CSS and JS to represent those contents to the web via API's( Application Program Interfaces)

* DOM: ' is a programming interface for web documents'
* DOM: ' represents the document as 'nodes' and 'objects' in order for programming languages to interact with the page

## What is a Web Page?: 

The web page is a document that can be displayed in a browser as an 'HTML' source
DOM & HTML is essentially one in the same only that the DOM allows for 'document manipulation' since it is an 'object' oriented representation of the web page. Javascript is a 'scripting' language which in turn allows us to modify the document via a 'scripting language' such as JavaScript.

**Scripting Languages** : can include
* Python
* Ruby
* C

To name a few. 
### Additional Notes: 

* The DOM is compromised of multiple API's working together to accomplish a different set of tasks
* The DOM is expanded depending on the specific API that is being updated to progress the DOM
* Ex. 'DOM is expanded upon as needed by other API's that add new features and capabilities ot the DOM
Ex. 'HTML DOM API : add support for representing HTML documents to the core DOM, and the ''SVG API '' adds support for representing SVG Documents
